# Hybrid Clustering with DBNS

This repository provides an implementation of a **Deep Autoencoderâ€“based Hybrid Clustering Framework** with **Dynamic Boundary Neighborhood Score (DBNS)** optimization, **outlier-aware reweighting**, and **sensitivity/ablation studies**.  

The framework integrates:
- **Autoencoder-based representation learning**
- **KMeans clustering in latent space**
- **Dynamic Mahalanobis distance thresholding (Ï„ = Î¼ + Î»Ïƒ)**
- **Reweighting mechanism to downweight potential outliers**
- **Iterative DBNS refinement loop**
- **t-SNE visualization of clusters**
- **Sensitivity analysis over Ï„, Î¸, and Î»**
- **Ablation experiments (Full vs. No DBNS vs. No Reweighting)**

## ðŸ“‚ Project Structure

When executed, the pipeline creates a dataset-specific folder inside the main results directory:

```
Hybrid Clustering with DBNS/
â”‚
â”œâ”€â”€ anemia/                         # Dataset-specific results
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ learning_curves/            # Autoencoder training loss plots
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ cluster_metrics/            # ARI, F1, DBNS evolution plots
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ tsne/                       # t-SNE before/after DBNS clustering
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ outlier/                    # Outlier distributions (histogram/boxplot)
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ sensitivity/                # Ï„, Î¸, and Î» sensitivity analyses
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ ablation/                   # Ablation study results
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ csv/                        # Metrics logs (CSV format)

##  Requirements

- Python 3.8+
- [TensorFlow 2.x / Keras](https://www.tensorflow.org/)
- NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Scikit-learn

Install dependencies with:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

(where `requirements.txt` should include: `tensorflow`, `numpy`, `pandas`, `matplotlib`, `scikit-learn`)

---

## Usage

1. Place your dataset CSV files in the working directory.  
   - The **last column** must be the ground-truth labels.  
   - All other columns are treated as features.

2. Update the dataset path inside the configuration:

```python
file_path = "anemia.csv"
#file_path = "pima.csv"
#file_path = "heart.csv"
...
```

3. Run the main script:

```bash
python main.py
```

## Outputs

At the end of execution, results will include:

- **Learning Curves**: AE training/validation loss.  
- **Clustering Metrics vs Epochs**: ARI, F1, DBNS evolution.  
- **t-SNE Visualizations**: Clusters before and after DBNS refinement.  
- **Outlier Analysis**: Histogram + boxplot of Mahalanobis scores.  
- **Sensitivity Analysis**:
  - Ï„ sweep (`mu + Î»Ïƒ`, varying Ï„)  
  - Î¸ sweep (weight factor for outliers)  
  - Î» sweep (lambda sensitivity with meanÂ±std reporting)  

Example Î»-sweep output (console and CSV):
```
[Î»-sweep] Suggested Î» = 1.20 (S/DB=0.487Â±0.000, ARI=0.007Â±0.000, Outlier=9.7%Â±0.0%)
```

- **Ablation Study**: Comparison of
  - Full method (DBNS + reweighting)
  - No DBNS
  - No Re-weighting

Results are stored as CSV and bar plots for visual comparison.

## Reported Metrics

- **Silhouette Score (SS)**
- **Daviesâ€“Bouldin Index (DBI)**
- **DBNS Ratio = SS/DBI**
- **Adjusted Rand Index (ARI)**
- **F1 Score (macro)**
- **Hubness Score**
- **AUC (if binary classification ground truth is available)**
