# Hybrid-Clustering-with-DBNS
Hybrid clustering: 2D autoencoder + K-Means. Flags outliers (Mahalanobis) with dynamic threshold τ=μ+λσ and optional re-weighting. Reports DBNS (Silhouette/DBI), ARI, F1. Saves t-SNE plots, learning curves, PDF/CSV results. Includes τ/θ/λ sensitivity and ablation studies.
